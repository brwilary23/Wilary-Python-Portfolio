This portfolio will be used to highlight my projects from the Elements of Computing 2 class.

I plan to organize it into 2 main parts: my main projects and my mini projects. Within these folders, I will have direct links to the code, a folder for the tools that I used, a list of skills used, and a folder for relevant visualizations and images.
