This portfolio will be used to highlight my projects from the Elements of Computing 2 class.

My first app, and the resources used to create it, are housed within the Basic Streamlit App folder. My first app allows a user to sort through Netflix content based on Type, Rating, and Year Released. 

In order to access this content, you have to use the Streamlit App. In order to do this, you myst use the run streamlit function in the console, streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py.
