This portfolio will be used to highlight my projects from the Elements of Computing 2 class.

## Basic Streamlit App

This original app allows one to sort through content on Netflix by type, rating, and release year. The idea behind this app is that it can help individuals easily find content they are looking for. The app's main contents are in main.py, while the Week_3_2 and Week_4_2 files were used for guidance.

This app was used to test my basic app creation skills. It allowed me to experiment with different methodologies for sorting through data, working with Streamlit, and adding visual aids in code. This will provide a basic foundation for my portfolio.

_TLDR Description:_ _This project sorts through Netflix content based on a variety of factors._

## 2008 Olympics Medalists Data Cleaning & Analysis

This project uses data cleaning and tidying principles to reshape and transform the 2008 Olympic Medalist Dataset. For this particular analysis, I want to evaluate how the number of medals collected differs by sport, and by gender within each sport. I also looked into how the number of each type of medal given out varied by sport and across the Olympics as a whole.

This app helped me to improve my data sorting techniques, particularly in working through the process of tidying data within a data frame. In this project, I was able to work with the matplotlib and pandas libraries. This allowed me to work with and learn how to use pivot tables and data sets to manipulate data and perform insights.

_TLDR Description:_ _This project cleans and evaluates data from the 2008 Olympic Medalist Dataset._


## Named Entity Recognition App - Streamlit
This project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to explore **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** by defining their own entity labels and identifying custom patterns in user-submitted text. Built using the **spaCy** NLP library and the **Streamlit** framework, this app allows me to utilize basic machine learning principles.


### üìå Project Overview
Named Entity Recognition is a task of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where entities such as names, organizations, dates, and locations are identified in text. This app demonstrates **spaCy‚Äôs rule-based `EntityRuler`**, allowing users to create and visualize their own NER patterns and labels.

Users can:
- Input their own sentence or paragraph
- Define multiple entity labels (like "names", "subjects", "events")
- Select specific words that belong to each label
- View real-time visualizations of their tagged text using spaCy's `displacy`

### üéØ Class Connection
This app was developed as part of my **Elements of Computing 2** course at the University of Notre Dame. It showcases my ability to:
- Work with advanced libraries like **spaCy**
- Design **user-driven interfaces** with **Streamlit**
- Combine **data logic, NLP, and interactivity** in one cohesive application
- Explain complex tools in an intuitive, visual way

This project also builds on my interest in **user-centric technology design**, and represents a meaningful step toward developing tools that make machine learning more understandable and hands-on for a broader audience.
