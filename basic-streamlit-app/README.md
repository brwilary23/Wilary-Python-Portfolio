## Basic Streamlit App

This original app allows one to sort through content on Netflix by type, rating, and release year. The idea behind this app is that it can help individuals easily find content they are looking for. The app's main contents are in main.py, while the Week_3_2 and Week_4_2 files were used for guidance.

_TLDR Description:_ _This project sorts through Netflix content based on a variety of factors._
