This original app allows one to sort through content on Netflix by type, rating, and release year. The idea behind this app is that it can help individuals easily find content they are looking for. The app's main contents are in main.py, while the Week_3_2 and Week_4_2 files were used for guidance.

To run in console, put in:  streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
