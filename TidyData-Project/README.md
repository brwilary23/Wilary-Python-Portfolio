# 2008 Olympics Medalists Data Cleaning & Analysis
This project uses data cleaning and tidying principles to reshape and transform the 2008 Olympic Medalist Dataset. For this particular analysis, I want to evaluate how the number of medals collected differs by sport, and by gender within each sport. 

### Project Goals:
- Apply tidy data principles to clean data
- Transform data
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis utilizing visualizations and pivot tables

*What is tidy data?*
Tidy data is data that is cleaned efficiently and effectively so that data can be manipulated, modeled, and visualized. It utilzies a structure where...
1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization:
- **Top 10 Sports** by medal count

- **Medal Gender Distribution** across all sports

## Pivot Table:
A **pivot table** was created, indexed by sport and sorted by gender, to provide a cleaner look at the data

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step
3. Review visualizations and pivot table insights
